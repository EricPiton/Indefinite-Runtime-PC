# Real-World Testing Notes:

# - Test Protocol:
#   - Baseline: 16–20 W loads, verify 20.1096 W output and storage gain
#   - Spikes: +10 W (26–30 W) for 300s, monitor storage drop/recovery
#   - Depletion: Sustained 30 W until 0 Wh, test post-depletion at 20.1096 W
# - Safety: Overheat sensors, breaker trip at >25 W output
